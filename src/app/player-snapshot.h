 * A window's own copy of the players it was opened with. The cache frees and republishes
 * gameContext.players whenever the save moves on, so a window that held pointers into it would
 * dangle; instead it holds this, and the copies are re-matched to the new buffer by uid after every
 * publish. A player who is no longer in the cache keeps the last data we saw for them.
 *
 * Player is a plain value — its injury name is an index into the interned table, which outlives
 * every cache — so copying one is a straight assignment.
 *
 * The array is allocated once and refreshed in place, so pointers into it stay valid for the life
 * of the window.
